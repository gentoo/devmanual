<title>Profiles <c>updates/</c> Directory</title>
<body>

<p>
The files in the <c>updates/</c> directory are organized by quarters of years
and are named <c>&lt;quarter&gt;Q-&lt;year&gt;</c>, e.g. <c>1Q-2010</c>
(quarter count is one-based).
</p>

<p>
These files are simple text files, where each line contains one of the following
commands. Note that these only cause the package manager to adjust its metadata,
the actual changes to the package have to be done manually.
