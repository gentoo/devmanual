<title>Repository metadata</title>

<body>
<p>
This section describes various metadata files used to control the repository.
For historical reasons, those files are scattered between the <c>metadata/</c>
and <c>profiles/</c> directories.
</p>
</body>

<section>
<title>profiles/eapi</title>

<body>
<p>
This file specifies the EAPI version of the repository metadata, in particular
the <c>profiles/</c> directory. If you are using newer EAPI extensions to some
of the files listed below, this file must specify the appropriate EAPI used.
</p>

<p>
If the file is not present, EAPI 0 is assumed.

<section>
<title>profiles/repo_name</title>

<body>
<p>
This file specifies the name of the repository. It must be present in every
repository, and it must be unique within the system. Furthermore, if you plan
to publish your repository, you should aim for a name unique within
the complete <uri link="https://repos.gentoo.org/">Gentoo repository list</uri>.
</p>

<p>
For example, the main Gentoo repository is named <c>gentoo</c>.

<section>
<title>metadata/layout.conf</title>

<body>
<p>
This file specifies additional parameters of the repository layout. It is
commonly present in Gentoo repositories to request inheritance from the Gentoo
repository:
</p>

<codesample>
# inherit eclasses, etc. from Gentoo
masters = gentoo
</codesample>

<p>
The file can also be used to control Manifest format, cache format, allowed
EAPIs and many more. The detailed option list can be found in <c>portage(5)</c>
manpage.
