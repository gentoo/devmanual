<title>Eclass Writing Guide</title>

<body>
<p>
This section provides a brief introduction to eclass authoring.
</p>

<important>
You should reread the <uri link="::general-concepts/overlay#Overlay and Eclasses"/>
and <uri link="::general-concepts/portage-cache"/> sections before continuing.
</important>

<section>
<title>Purpose of Eclasses</title>
<body>

<p>
An eclass is a collection of code which can be used by more than one ebuild. At
the time of writing, all eclasses live in the <c>eclass/</c> directory in the tree.
Roughly speaking, there are three kinds of eclass:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Those which provide common functions which are used by many ebuilds (for
    example, <c>eutils</c>, <c>versionator</c>, <c>cvs</c>, <c>bash-completion</c>)
  </li>
  <li>
    Those which provide a basic build system for many similar packages (for
    example, <c>vim-plugin</c>, <c>kde</c>)
  </li>
  <li>
    Those which handle one or a small number of packages with complex build
    systems (for example, <c>vim</c>, <c>toolchain</c>, <c>kernel-2</c>)
  </li>
</ul>

<section>
<title>Adding and Updating Eclasses</title>
<body>

<p>
Before committing a new eclass to the tree, it should be emailed to the
gentoo-dev mailing list with a justification and a proposed implementation. Do
not skip this step <d/> sometimes a better implementation or an alternative which
does not require a new eclass will be suggested.
</p>

<p>
Before updating <c>eutils</c> or a similar widely used eclass, it is best to email
the gentoo-dev list. It may be that your proposed change is broken in a way you
had not anticipated, or that there is an existing function which performs the
same purpose, or that your function may be better off in its own eclass. If you
don't email gentoo-dev first, and end up breaking something, expect to be in a
lot of trouble.
</p>

<p>
If there is an existing maintainer for an eclass (this is usually the case), you
<b>must</b> talk to the maintainer before committing any changes.
</p>

<p>
It is not usually necessary to email the gentoo-dev list before making changes
to a non-general eclass which you maintain. Use common sense here.
</p>

<warning>
Committing a broken eclass can kill huge numbers of packages. Since
<c>repoman</c> is not eclass-aware, be very sure you do proper testing.
</warning>

<p>
A simple way to verify syntax is <c>bash -n foo.eclass</c>.

<section>
<title>Removing Eclasses</title>
<body>

<p>No longer used eclasses may be removed from the tree, but developers must
adhere to the following process(developers must follow these rules because
packages installed with a portage version of less than 2.1.4 would break
during uninstallation or upgrades):</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Make sure that no packages or other eclasses in the tree <c>inherit</c> the
    eclass.
  </li>
  <li>
    Send a message to the gentoo-dev and gentoo-dev-announce mailing lists
    announcing that the eclass you are deprecating is now deprecated.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add a warning to all installation phases that the eclass is now deprecated,
    perhaps with a hint at what, if any, eclass replaced the functionality that
    the old eclass provided.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remove all functionality related to installation of packages from the eclass.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add a one line comment saying exactly <c># @DEAD</c> so that the
    eclass-manpages package will not attempt to document it.
  </li>
  <li>
    After two years have passed since the eclass was deprecated, the eclass may
    be removed from the portage tree.
  </li>
</ol>

<section>
<title>Basic Eclass Format</title>
<body>

<p>
An eclass is a <c>bash</c> script which is sourced within the ebuild environment.
Files should be a simple text file with a <c>.eclass</c> extension. Allowed
characters in the filename are lowercase letters, the digits 0-9, hyphens,
underscores and dots. Eclasses are not intrinsically versioned.
</p>

<p>
Eclasses should start with the standard ebuild header, along with comments
explaining the maintainer and purpose of the eclass, and any other relevant
documentation.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Eclass Variables</title>
<body>

<p>
Top level variables may be defined as for ebuilds. If any USE flags are
used, <c>IUSE</c> must be set. The <c>KEYWORDS</c> variable must <b>not</b> be set in an
eclass.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Eclass Functions</title>
<body>

<p>
Eclasses may define functions. These functions will be visible to anything which
inherits the eclass.
</p>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Simple Common Functions Eclass Example</title>
<body>

<p>
As an example, the following eclass was written to illustrate a better way of
installing OSX application files during a discussion on this subject. It defines
a single function, <c>domacosapp</c>.
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
# Copyright 1999-2005 Gentoo Foundation
# Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License v2
# $Header: $

#
# Original Author: Ciaran McCreesh &lt;ciaranm@gentoo.org&gt;
# Purpose: install macos .app files to the relevant location.
#
# Bugs to osx@gentoo.org
#

# domacosapp: install a macos .app file. Usage is 'domacosapp file' or
# 'domacosapp file newfile'.

domacosapp() {
    [[ -z "${1}" ]] &amp;&amp; die "usage: domacosapp &lt;file&gt; &lt;new file&gt;"
    if useq ppc-macos ; then
        insinto /Applications
        newins "$1" "${2:-${1}}" || die "Failed to install ${1}"
    fi
}
</codesample>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Export Functions</title>
<body>

<p>
An eclass may provide default implementations for any of the standard ebuild
functions (<c>src_unpack</c>, <c>pkg_postinst</c> etc). This can be done either as a
simple function definition (which is not multiple eclass friendly) or using
<c>EXPORT_FUNCTIONS</c>. Functions given to <c>EXPORT_FUNCTIONS</c> are implemented
as normal, but have their name prefixed with <c>${ECLASS}_</c>.
</p>

<important>
Only 'standard' functions should be specified in <c>EXPORT_FUNCTIONS</c>.
</important>

<note><c>EXPORT_FUNCTIONS</c> is a function, <e>not</e> a variable.</note>

<p>
If multiple eclasses export the same function, the latest (inherited last)
defined version wins.  If an ebuild defines a function that is exported, this
gets priority over any eclass version. This can be used to override
eclass-defined defaults <d/> for example, say we had <c>fnord.eclass</c>:
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
EXPORT_FUNCTIONS src_compile

fnord_src_compile() {
    do_stuff || die
}
</codesample>

<p>
Then an ebuild could do this:
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
inherit fnord.eclass

src_compile() {
    do_pre_stuff || die
    fnord_src_compile
    do_post_stuff || die
}
</codesample>

</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Simple Build System Eclass Example</title>
<body>

<p>
A simple eclass which defines a number of functions and a default
<c>src_compile</c> for the (hypothetical) <c>jmake</c> build system might look
something like the following:
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
# Copyright 1999-2005 Gentoo Foundation
# Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License v2
# $Header: $

# Original Author: Ciaran McCreesh &lt;ciaranm@gentoo.org&gt;
# Purpose: Demonstration of EXPORT_FUNCTIONS. Defines simple wrappers for the
# (hypothetical) 'jmake' build system and a default src_compile.

EXPORT_FUNCTIONS src_compile

DEPEND="&gt;=sys-devel/jmake-2"

jmake-configure() {
    jmake configure --prefix=/usr "$@"
}

jmake-build() {
    jmake dep &amp;&amp; jmake build "$@"
}

jmake_src_compile() {
    jmake-configure || die "configure failed"
    jmake-build || die "build failed"
}
</codesample>
