<title>Package and slot moves</title>

<body>
<p>
This chapter describes the use of package and slot moves. The package update
mechanism is a powerful too, and needs to be used with caution. In particular,
the following must be noted:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Updates are <e>not one-shot</e> operations and they are not stateful. All
    updates can be reapplied multiple times to the same system, and all old
    updates are applied to fresh Gentoo installations.
  </li>

  <li>
    Once an update entry is created, the old package name (slot) cannot be
    reused. Attempting to reuse it will cause updates to apply again,
    to the reused name. This also means that updates cannot be undone.
  </li>

  <li>
    Updates can only perform 1:1 moves. They cannot be used to merge packages.
    Attempting to move two or more packages into a single name may cause serious
    problems for the users.
  </li>
</ol>

<title>Moving a package</title>
<body>

<p>
Moving a package in the tree requires several operations. Firstly,
the package directory needs to be moved to the correct category
using <c>git mv</c>. After this, a new entry needs to be added to
the latest file in <c>profiles/updates/</c> in the
following format:
</p>

<pre>
move old-category/package-name new-category/package-name
</pre>

<p>
Following the update entry, ebuilds that have a
<uri link="::general-concepts/dependencies">dependency</uri>
to this package (in other words, the reverse dependencies of
the package to be moved) need to be updated properly.
</p>

<p>
Next is checking the files under <c>profiles/</c> such as
<c>profiles/package.mask</c> and update them to reflect the ebuild
move. Various eclasses automatically provide some of the dependencies upon
inherit, so the files under <c>eclass/</c> should be checked and updated
properly. If the package metadata.xml has tags with <c>restrict</c>
attribute, they should be updated to reflect the move. The
metadata.xml for various packages may contain references to the
package being moved using the <c>&lt;pkg&gt;</c> tag which need to be
updated accordingly as well. Lastly, the titles of the open bugs
related to the package should be updated.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example where the package
<c>net-misc/fwbuilder</c> is transparently moved to
<c>net-firewall/fwbuilder</c>:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Issue <c>git mv net-misc/fwbuilder net-firewall/fwbuilder</c></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Add the following entry to the latest file in
      <c>profile/updates/</c>:
    </p>
    <p><c>move net-misc/fwbuilder net-firewall/fwbuilder</c></p>
  </li>
  <li>Update the reverse dependencies of the package</li>
  <li>
    Update <c>profiles/package.mask</c> and other related files under
    <c>profiles/</c>
  </li>
  <li>Check the eclasses that may be referencing the package</li>
  <li>
    Update all the
    <uri link="::ebuild-writing/misc-files/metadata">metadata.xml</uri>
    files which contain a reference to this package using the
    <c>&lt;pkg&gt;</c> tag or the <c>restrict</c> attribute.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stage all the changed files using <c>git add</c>. For example: <c>git add
    profiles/package.mask</c>
  </li>
  <li>
    Commit all the changes in one commit using: <c>git commit --gpg-sign --signoff</c>
  </li>
  <li>
    Update any <uri link="::general-concepts/news">news items</uri>
    referencing the package in a <c>Display-If-Installed</c> header
    or in the item's body (and increment their <c>Revision</c>).
  </li>
  <li>Update any open bugs related to the package</li>
</ol>

<p>
It is very important to commit all the changes in a single commit to ensure
that no breakage occurs. The commit message should follow a format similar
to the following:
</p>

<pre>
commit 7a699bcdce5c1412c02a2aa7717a31bc17c49058
Author: Miroslav Šulc &lt;fordfrog@gentoo.org&gt;

  media-libs/libclxclient: moved to x11-libs/libclxclient

<title>Changing ebuild's SLOT</title>
<body>
<p>
The process for changing the ebuild's SLOT is very similar to the
previous process.  Besides changing the SLOT in the ebuild file, you
also need to create a new entry in <c>profiles/updates/</c> in
the Gentoo repository in the following format:
</p>

<pre>
slotmove app-text/gtkspell 0 2
</pre>

<p>
Make sure that you have fixed all the reverse dependencies and that
you have updated every file in <c>profiles/</c> directory that
happens to contain an entry which may be affected by your change.
