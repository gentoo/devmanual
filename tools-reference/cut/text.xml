<title><c>cut</c> -- Column Concatenation</title>
<body>

<p>
The <c>cut</c> tool can be used to extract specific columns from files
which are delimited by a particular character or by column numbers. It
can be passed filenames on the commandline; if none are specified, it
reads from stdin.
</p>

<p>
The <c>cut</c> tool considers the first character in a line to have
index <c>1</c>. The <c>-c</c>, <c>-f</c> and <c>-b</c> switches take a
parameter listing the desired columns. This can be a single value, or
a more complex list of values separated by commas. Each value can be a
single number, or two numbers separated by hyphens representing
<c>low-high</c>. If <c>low</c> is unspecified, it is treated as the
first column. If <c>high</c> is unspecified, it is treated as being
"up to the last character (inclusive)".
</p>

<p>
To select particular characters from each line, use the <c>-c</c>
switch. For particular bytes (not the same as characters when using
multibyte text), use <c>-b</c>. To specify particular fields,
use <c>-f</c>.
</p>

<p>
When using <c>-f</c>, the field delimiter can be specified using the
<c>-d</c> switch. The default value is the tab character. The
<c>-s</c> switch instructs <c>cut</c> to suppress lines which do not
contain any instances of the delimiter <d/> by default they are echoed
intact.
</p>

<p>
For example, to extract the second, fourth and fifth columns in a
comma-delimited file, ignoring lines which contain no commas, one
could use:
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
cut -s -d',' -f2,4-5 input.txt > output.txt
</codesample>

<p>
To chop the first character off stdin, one could use:
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
do_stuff | cut -c2-
</codesample>
