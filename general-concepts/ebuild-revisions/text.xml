<title>Ebuild Revisions</title>

<body>
<p>
Ebuilds may have a Gentoo revision number associated with them. This is a
<c>-rX</c> suffix, where <c>X</c> is an integer <d/> see <uri
link="::ebuild-writing/file-format#File Naming Rules"/>. This
component must only be used for Gentoo changes, not upstream releases. By
default, <c>-r0</c> is implied.
</p>

<p>
Ebuilds should have their <c>-rX</c> incremented whenever a change is made which
will make a substantial difference to what gets installed by the package <d/> by
substantial, we generally mean "something for which many users would want to
upgrade". This is usually for bugfixes.
</p>

<p>
Simple compile fixes do <b>not</b> warrant a revision bump; this is because they do
not affect the installed package for users who already managed to compile it.
Small documentation fixes are also usually not grounds for a new revision.
</p>

<important>
For ebuilds marked stable on at least one arch, only trivial edits can be made
without a bump (e.g. typo fixes in elog messages). Even simple changes may
result in a breakage. <b>Modifying stable ebuilds should be avoided.</b>
</important>

<p>
When doing a revision bump, the usual rules about dropping to <c>~arch</c> apply.
