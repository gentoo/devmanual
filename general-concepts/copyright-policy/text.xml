<p>
<uri link="https://www.gentoo.org/glep/glep-0076.html">GLEP-76</uri> defines
copyright and license policies for Gentoo Linux.
</p>

<p>
Every Gentoo project must abide by the
<uri link="https://www.gentoo.org/get-started/philosophy/social-contract.html">
Gentoo Social Contract</uri> and release its work under one or more of
<uri link="https://www.gentoo.org/glep/glep-0076.html#licensing-of-gentoo-projects">
predetermined licenses</uri>. Exceptions may be granted by the Gentoo
Foundation per-case basis.

<title>Certificate of Origin</title>
<body>

<p>
Per <uri link="https://www.gentoo.org/glep/glep-0076.html">GLEP 76
(Copyright Policy)</uri>, you must sign-off all your commits to any
Gentoo-hosted repository with accordance to the
<uri link="https://www.gentoo.org/glep/glep-0076.html#certificate-of-origin">
copyright policy</uri>.
</p>

<p>
When committing work authored by someone else, e.g. a Bugzilla patch, or GitHub
pull request, a sign-off from the original author is always strongly
recommended, in order to indicate that the author acknowledges Gentoo's
copyright policy. However, it is not mandatory for every case. Please refer to
the example list below when determining whether a sign-off from the original
author is, or is not required. The list below serves as a general guideline.

<subsection>
<title>Examples for general guideline</title>
<body>

<dl>
  <dt>A contribution with a Signed-off-by line by its author</dt>
  <dd>
    Can be accepted, because the author confirmed that it is under a free
    software license. The committer adds another S-o-b line and certifies the
    commit under point 4 of the
    <uri link="https://www.gentoo.org/glep/glep-0076.html#certificate-of-origin">
    Certificate of Origin</uri>.
    <note>
    Use common sense here, especially if you don't know the contributor. If the
    contribution was taken from somewhere else and the contributor doesn't have
    the right to distribute it under a free software license, you as the
    committer might get into trouble. So in this situation, do your best to
    check repositories for matching code, and whether they hold any special
    copyright claims.
    </note>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    A contribution without a S-o-b line and of significant size, but with an
    independent indication of its license (e.g. copyright and license notices
    in the file's header)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Can be accepted. The committer adds a S-o-b line and certifies the commit
    under point 2 of the Certificate of Origin.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    A contribution without a S-o-b line but not
    <uri link="https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Legally-Significant.html">
    "legally significant"</uri> (by the FSF's 15-lines rule of thumb)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Can be accepted. The committer adds a S-o-b line and certifies the commit
    under point 2 of the Certificate of Origin.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    A contribution without a S-o-b line and of significant size, without any
    other indication of its license
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Can <e>not</e> be accepted. There's no indication that the author has
    released their work under a free license, therefore it must not be
    distributed by Gentoo.
