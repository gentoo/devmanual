<title>Licenses</title>

<body>
<p>
All ebuilds must specify a <c>LICENSE</c> (note the American English
spelling) variable. The license names listed in this variable must
match files existing in the repository's <c>licenses/</c> directory.
</p>

<p>
The value of this variable should include all licenses pertaining
to the files installed by the package. If some parts of the package
are installed only conditionally, or their license depends on the USE
flag combination, you can use USE conditionals in <c>LICENSE</c>:
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
LICENSE="LGPL-2.1+ tools? ( GPL-2+ )"
</codesample>

<p>
If the package sources include additional files that are not installed,
their license should not be listed. However, if those files are used
at build time, then the license must not impose any restrictions that
could prevent users from building the software. Please also note
that some licenses may impose additional restrictons, e.g. fetch
and/or mirroring restriction.
</p>

<p>
If the application is multi-license (either of several licenses can
be used) then use the following syntax:
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
LICENSE="|| ( foo bar )"
</codesample>

<title>Determining the correct license</title>
<body>

<warning>
Do not trust the license indicated by GitHub or other sites that use
automation to guess the license! The information presented may be
incomplete and/or incorrect.
</warning>

<p>
To establish the correct value of <c>LICENSE</c>, you need to trace
the licenses of all installed files. Normally, the licenses of output
files (compiled executables, generated files) are implied
by the licenses of the relevant input files.
</p>

<p>
When looking for license information, the following should be
considered:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<c>COPYING*</c> and <c>LICENSE*</c> files distributed with
		the package
	</li>
	<li>
		explicit statements in documentation
	</li>
	<li>
		explicit license notices in source and data files
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
The latter (more specific) options take precedence over the former.
In particular, <c>COPYING*</c> files are frequently included as hardcopies
of applicable licenses but the exact application of licenses and their
versions are specified elsewhere.

<title>Detecting and solving upstream license problems</title>
<body>

<p>
While adding new packages, you need to be watchful for upstream license
problems. Please understand that they may not only affect upstream
but also put yourself and our users in danger. Even if you could
reasonably assume nobody would pursue legal action against our users,
they may be forced to put significant effort in replacing problematic
modules.
</p>

<p>
If you notice specific copyright problems, please report them upstream.
You may ask the Gentoo licenses team for guidance. In general, it is
preferable to wait for upstream to resolve the issue and release a new
version.
</p>

<p>
Common license problems include but are not limited to:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Including third party code without appropriate copyright notices.
      Practically all licenses (with notable exception of public
      domain-alike) require attribution, and some require copying
      original copyright notices verbatim.
    </p>

    <p>
      This issue can be fixed by readding the original copyright
      notices upstream. Please note that the license of the project may
      need to be reevaluated afterwards.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Combining incompatible licenses. When you are combining multiple
      files using different licenses into a single executable, those
      licenses need to be compatible. For example, it is not possible
      to combine proprietary code with copyleft licenses (e.g. GPL).
      But it is also incorrect to combine GPL-2 and GPL-3 code.
    </p>

    <p>
      In some cases, upstream may be able to resolve the issue by
      relicensing parts of the code to a compatible license. However,
      this requires permission from copyright holders. If this is
      not feasible, the incompatible code can be either removed or
      replaced with an alternative implementation. If the original code
      is independently rewritten, a clean room design is recommended.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Dynamically linking incompatible executables. Arguably, some
      licenses also apply restriction on dynamic linking between
      executables and shared libraries. For example, normally you can't
      link GPL executables with OpenSSL. The same restriction does not
      apply to LGPL, and some projects are adding specific linking
      exceptions to their GPL usage.
    </p>

    <p>
      The solutions are the same as for incompatible code.
      The incompatible modules may either be relicensed (if possible),
      removed or replaced.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Wrong or incomplete license information about a project. Upstream
      may indicate the wrong effective license for a project (e.g.
      in README. For example, upstream may indicate that the project
      is licensed as GPL-2+ while some of the source code files use
      GPL-3+ license.
    </p>

    <p>
      This issue can usually be satisfiably resolved downstream by
      indicating the correct effective license in <c>LICENSE</c>.
      However, it should be nevertheless reported upstream as it may
      indicate mistakes and be source of further issues in the future.
    </p>

<title>GPL-x vs GPL-x+</title>
<body>

<p>
FSF licenses (GPL, LGPL, AGPL, FDL) occur in two variants: the 'vN only'
and 'vN or later' variants. In Gentoo, the licenses of the latter variants
are denoted by appending
a plus sign (+) to their respective license notations of the former variant,
e.g. <c>GPL-2+</c> and <c>GPL-2</c>.
</p>

<p>
Determining the correct variant usually requires looking for copyright
notices in the code. For example, the following copyright notice
indicates <c>GPL-2+</c> license:
</p>

<pre>
 * This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or 
 * modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as

<section>
<title>Adding New Licenses</title>
<body>

<p>
If your package's license is not already in the tree, you must add the
license before committing the package. When adding the license, use a
plain text file (UTF-8 encoded) if at all possible. Some licenses are
PDF files rather than plain text <d/> this should only be done if we
are legally required to do so.
Finally you need to check if your license should be added to a license group
as listed in $PORTDIR/profiles/license_groups. For more information see the
<uri link="https://www.gentoo.org/glep/glep-0023.html">GLEP 23</uri>.
</p>

<p>
It is not normally necessary to mail the <c>gentoo-dev</c> list or
<c>licenses@gentoo.org</c> before adding a new license. You should
only do so if the license could be considered 'questionable' or if
you are unsure as to the meaning of any part of it.
