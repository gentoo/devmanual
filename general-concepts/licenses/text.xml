<title>Licenses</title>

<body>
<p>
All ebuilds must specify a <c>LICENSE</c> (note the American English
spelling) variable. The value of this variable must be the name of a
file in the Portage tree's <c>licenses/</c> directory.
</p>

<p>
If the application is multi-license (either of several licenses can
be used) then use the following syntax:
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
LICENSE="|| ( foo bar )"
</codesample>

<title>Adding New Licenses</title>
<body>

<p>
If your package's license is not already in the tree, you must add the
license before committing the package. When adding the license, use a
plain text file (UTF-8 encoded) if at all possible. Some licenses are
PDF files rather than plain text <d/> this should only be done if we
are legally required to do so.
Finally you need to check if your license should be added to a license group
as listed in $PORTDIR/profiles/license_groups. For more information see the
<uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/glep/glep-0023.html">GLEP 23</uri>
</p>

<p>
It is not normally necessary to mail the <c>gentoo-dev</c> list or
<c>licenses@gentoo.org</c> before adding a new license. You should
only do so if the license could be considered 'questionable' or if
you are unsure as to the meaning of any part of it.
