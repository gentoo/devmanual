<title>Licenses</title>

<body>
<p>
All ebuilds must specify a <c>LICENSE</c> (note the American English
spelling) variable. The license names listed in this variable must
match files existing in the repository's <c>licenses/</c> directory.
</p>

<p>
The value of this variable should include all licenses pertaining
to the files installed by the package. If some parts of the package
are installed only conditionally, or their license depends on the USE
flag combination, you can use USE conditionals in <c>LICENSE</c>:
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
LICENSE="LGPL-2.1+ tools? ( GPL-2+ )"
</codesample>

<p>
If the package sources include additional files that are not installed,
their license should not be listed. However, if those files are used
at build time, then the license must not impose any restrictions that
could prevent users from building the software. Please also note
that some licenses may impose additional restrictons, e.g. fetch
and/or mirroring restriction.
</p>

<p>
If the application is multi-license (either of several licenses can
be used) then use the following syntax:
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
LICENSE="|| ( foo bar )"
</codesample>

<title>Adding New Licenses</title>
<body>

<p>
If your package's license is not already in the tree, you must add the
license before committing the package. When adding the license, use a
plain text file (UTF-8 encoded) if at all possible. Some licenses are
PDF files rather than plain text <d/> this should only be done if we
are legally required to do so.
Finally you need to check if your license should be added to a license group
as listed in $PORTDIR/profiles/license_groups. For more information see the
<uri link="https://www.gentoo.org/glep/glep-0023.html">GLEP 23</uri>.
</p>

<p>
It is not normally necessary to mail the <c>gentoo-dev</c> list or
<c>licenses@gentoo.org</c> before adding a new license. You should
only do so if the license could be considered 'questionable' or if
you are unsure as to the meaning of any part of it.
