<p>
In the tree, every package has a <c>Manifest</c> file. This file lives
in the same directory as the ebuilds for the package. The <c>Manifest</c> file
contains digests (the current list can be found in <c>metadata/layout.conf</c>
as <c>manifest-hashes</c>) and file size data for every distfile used
by the package. This is used to verify integrity upon fetching them.
</p>

<p>
To generate the <c>Manifest</c>, use <c>ebuild foo.ebuild manifest</c>.
