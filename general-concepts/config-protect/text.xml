<title>Configuration File Protection</title>

<body>
<p>
  Portage includes a system for configuration file protection which means ebuilds
  don't have to worry about accidentally clobbering files in <c>/etc</c>. This is
  known as 'protection', and it is controlled by the <c>CONFIG_PROTECT</c> and
  <c>CONFIG_PROTECT_MASK</c> variables.
</p>

<p>
  Any directory which is listed in <c>CONFIG_PROTECT</c> (and any subdirectories
  thereof), except for any which are listed in <c>CONFIG_PROTECT_MASK</c> (and
  subdirectories) are automatically 'protected' by Portage when copying an image
  from <c>DESTDIR</c> to <c>ROOT</c>. Rather than installing protected files directly,
  Portage will install them as <c>._cfg0000_filename</c>. These can then be processed
  by the <c>etc-update</c> or <c>dispatch-conf</c> files at the user's discretion.
</p>

<p>
  Packages must <b>not</b> attempt to override this system via <c>pkg_postinst</c> or
  similar. If you need a file renamed, removed or changed in a particular way, you
  should display a message informing the user.
