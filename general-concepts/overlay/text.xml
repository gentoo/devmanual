<title>Overlay</title>

<body>
<p>
Portage can look in multiple places for packages by using an overlay. The
locations of overlays are controlled by the <c>PORTDIR_OVERLAY</c> variable, which
should contain a space-separated list of paths.
</p>

<p>
The overlay should contain the same directory structure as <c>PORTDIR</c> (although
only the necessary directories need be included). For example, a simple overlay
might have a directory structure like:
</p>

<pre>
overlay
|-- dev-util
    `-- gengetopt
        |-- Manifest
        |-- files
        |   `-- gengetopt-2.13-foobar.patch
        `-- gengetopt-2.13.ebuild
</pre>

<p>
An overlay can be used to 'add' items to the tree (although you must ensure that
<c>/etc/portage/categories</c> is used if any new categories are added) or to
override existing entries.
</p>

<title>Overlay and Eclasses</title>

<body>
<p>
Be very careful when using eclasses in an overlay. Portage will not do cache
updates when an overlay eclass is changed, nor will it do cache updates when a
main Gentoo repository eclass which is used by an overlay ebuild changes. You may
also encounter bogus 'illegal inherit' notices when working with eclasses in
an overlay (see <uri
link="::appendices/common-problems/#QA Notice -- ECLASS foo inherited illegally"/>).
To be safe, manually <c>touch</c> all relevant overlay files after updating overlay
eclasses.
