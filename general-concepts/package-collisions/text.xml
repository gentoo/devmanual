<title>Package collisions</title>
<body>

<p>
When you encounter a package that is trying to install files that are
already provided by another package (detectable with
<c>FEATURES=collision-protect</c> for example) you have to fix this
situation before you can commit the ebuild or, if you encounter this
with an existing package, file a bug about that package (see below for
a few exceptions). The reason file conflicts are critical is because
if "foo" provides the file <c>/usr/bin/example</c> and "bar" is
going to overwrite it, and later "bar" is unmerged, Portage will remove
<c>/usr/bin/example</c> and it is therefore likely it will break
"foo".
</p>

<p>
The most obvious fix is to add a blocking dependency to both packages
that want to install that file, so they can't be installed at the same
time. But unless there are also other reasons for those packages to
block each other you should avoid this if possible and rather fix the
package, which could include one or more of the following steps:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make "foo" (R)DEPEND on "bar" and not install the conflicting
  file.</li>
  <li>Remove conflicting files from "foo" in <c>src_install</c>
  or <c>pkg_preinst</c>.</li>
  <li>Move conflicting files into a new subpackage and make "foo" and
  "bar" both (R)DEPEND on that package.</li>
  <li>Change the location where "foo" or "bar" installs conflicting
  files.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In some cases conflicting files can't be really fixed or aren't
critical, currently known exceptions are Perl module manpages
(overwriting the ones from Perl itself) and <c>CONFIG_PROTECT</c>'ed
files (which should still be fixed, but aren't critical as Portage
won't overwrite them).
