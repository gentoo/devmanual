<p>
Virtuals are merely packages that are in the category of <c>virtual</c>.  They
use their dependency string to specify the providers for the virtual and should
not install any files.  Since they are regular ebuilds, there can be several
versions of a virtual (which can be helpful when a package may be provided by
another in some versions, and not others <d/> see the perl virtuals for an
example of this).  One other difference (besides not installing any files) is
that a virtual does not define <c>HOMEPAGE</c> and <c>LICENSE</c> variables.
Since it installs no files, it really does not have a license.
</p>

<p>
Before adding a new virtual, it should be discussed on <c>gentoo-dev</c>.

<p>
An example of a virtual:

<codesample lang="ebuild">
EAPI=4

DESCRIPTION="Virtual for C++ tr1 &lt;type_traits&gt;"
SLOT="0"
KEYWORDS="alpha amd64 arm hppa ia64 ~mips ppc ppc64 ~s390 sparc x86 ~x86-fbsd"

RDEPEND="|| ( >=sys-devel/gcc-4.1 dev-libs/boost )"
</codesample>

Looks familar...right?  It should since its going to look just like a regular
ebuild.
</p>

<note>
The so-called <e>old-style</e> or <c>PROVIDE</c> type virtuals have been banned
from the Portage tree.
