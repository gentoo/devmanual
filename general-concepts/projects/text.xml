<title>Projects</title>
<body>

<p>
The management structure of Gentoo, called the "metastructure", is
defined in
<uri link="https://www.gentoo.org/glep/glep-0039.html#specification">
GLEP 39</uri>. In Gentoo, a project is a group of developers working
towards a common goal in various different areas. For example, the
<uri link="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Devmanual">
Devmanual</uri> project focuses on maintaining this document. Many
others are responsible for maintaining packages. Projects spanning a
large area of topics can have multiple subprojects specializing in
particular fields within the domain of the parent project and thus
form a project hierarchy.
</p>

<p>
A package maintained by a project needs to have the
project explicitly listed as a maintainer in its
<uri link="::ebuild-writing/misc-files/metadata">metadata.xml</uri>.
The full listing of all the projects can be found on
<uri link="https://api.gentoo.org/metastructure/projects.xml">
api.gentoo.org</uri> or on the
<uri link="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Gentoo">wiki</uri>.

<title>Starting New Projects</title>
<body>

<p>
According to the metastructure any developer may create a new
project. There are two procedures involved in starting a new project:

<ol>
  <li>
    Create a new project page <uri
    link="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Gentoo_Wiki:Developer_Central/Project_pages">
    through the wiki</uri>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Post a Request For Comments (RFC) email to the gentoo-dev
    mailing list.
  </li>
</ol>

There is no approval required for the RFC and negative comments do not
block a developer from creating a project. Competing projects are
allowed to co-exist in Gentoo; existence of another project with
similar goals do not block another developer from starting a new
project with the same goals.
</p>

<section>
<title>Joining and Leaving a Project</title>
<body>

<p>
Members of a project are managed through the project's page on the
Gentoo Wiki. Each page has a "Project" template in its source which
lists the members of the project. Simply modifying the list is
sufficient for adding or removing a developer. Note that different
projects have different requirements and procedures for recruiting
developers, which may require prior arrangements to be made before
modifying the member list.
</p>

<p>
Developers should remember to add themselves to the alias by editing
<c><path>/var/mail/alias/misc/&lt;alias name&gt;</path></c> on
dev.gentoo.org. For example, the alias for the Devmanual project is
located at <c>/var/mail/alias/misc/devmanual</c>, which corresponds to
the project's email address <c>devmanual@gentoo.org</c>.
