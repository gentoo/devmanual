<title>Where to find the sources</title>
<body>

<p>
Currently, sources are hosted on
<uri link="https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/devmanual.git">git.gentoo.org</uri>.
For current Gentoo developers, access is at
<c>git+ssh://git@git.gentoo.org/proj/devmanual.git</c>.
Non-developers can clone the repository by typing
<c>git clone git://anongit.gentoo.org/proj/devmanual.git</c>.
The sources are also hosted on
<uri link="https://github.com/gentoo/devmanual">GitHub</uri>
for those who prefer to submit patches using pull requests.
</p>

<p>
To build the devmanual, simply run <c>make</c> in the top directory of
the repository. You need <c>xsltproc</c> (from <pkg>dev-libs/libxslt</pkg>)
for the XML to HTML conversion, <c>xmllint</c> (from <pkg>dev-libs/libxml2</pkg>)
for validation, and <pkg>rsvg-convert</pkg> (from <pkg>gnome-base/librsvg</pkg>)
for the SVG to PNG conversion used in some of the figures throughout the document.
</p>

<p>
To check if the document's XML is valid, run <c>make validate</c> in the
top-level directory, which will validate all XML files using <c>xmllint</c>.

<title>Quick introduction to DevBook XML</title>
<body>

<p>
DevBook XML is heavily based on GuideXML and many tags are similar, if not
the same. The main differences occur in layout which are designed to make
a large-scale publication easier to produce and manage using a hierarchical
tree system. Before starting off you really should first examine the
<uri link="::appendices/devbook-guide/">DevBook XML guide</uri> in a reasonable
amount of depth.

<title>Differences from GuideXML</title>
<body>

<dl>
  <dt>
    Indentation
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Indent when needed <d/> you should not indent any section flow elements
    such as <c>&lt;subsection&gt;</c> but do indent tables, lists and
    definition lists. Do <e>not</e> indent text in ordinary paragraph blocks.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Code samples
  </dt>
  <dd>
    You can use the normal GuideXML tag <c>&lt;pre&gt;</c> when you need
    no syntax highlighting. When you need syntax highlighting use the
    <c>&lt;codesample&gt;</c> tag along with a <c>lang</c> attribute <d/>
    usually you want this to be set to <c>ebuild</c> to syntax highlight ebuild
    code snippets.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Hierarchy
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The whole document is organized as a tree. Each directory can contain
    one document. Each document can inherit multiple sub-documents using the
    <c>&lt;include&gt;</c> flag. You <b>must</b> ensure that the <c>self</c>
    tag in each document correctly points to the relative path of the document
    from the root node so that the tree-walking algorithms work correctly.
