<title>UTF-8 support</title>
<body>

<p>
GNU Emacs has built-in Unicode support, and since version 23 it uses
UTF-8 as its internal encoding. It is recommended to start Emacs from
within a UTF-8 locale which will control the default coding system.
</p>

<p>
Emacs will normally autodetect the coding system for given text.
In rare cases it may be necessary to tell Emacs that a UTF-8 file is
being opened by prefixing the <c>C-x C-f</c> or <c>C-x C-v</c> command
with <c>C-x C-m c utf-8 RET</c>. As a diagnostic measure, the coding
system currently in use can be determined with <c>C-h C RET</c>.
</p>

<p>
If it is desired to prefer UTF-8 to the regular character set in a
non-UTF-8 locale, the following can be used inside of the Emacs
startup file:
</p>

<pre>
    (prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)
</pre>

<title>Configuration tips and tricks</title>
<body>

<p>
Files must end with a newline, in order to let tools like <c>diff</c>
operate properly. To avoid accidental deletions, setting
<c>(setq require-final-newline 'ask)</c> in your startup file will
automatically check for the existence of it and ask you to add one.
</p>

<p>
Other useful settings can be disabled backup files
(by <c>(setq make-backup-files nil)</c>, so you don't clutter the git
repository
directories and confuse repoman with it (by adding unnecessary entries
into a Manifest file e.g.). Emacs can even contact the outside world
by using the X servers clipboard abilities when yanking, which is
activated by <c>(setq x-select-enable-clipboard t)</c>.

<title>Gentoo specific additions</title>
<body>

<p>
For easy editing of ebuilds an Emacs mode has been created, which is
found in the package <c>app-emacs/ebuild-mode</c>.
It supports ebuilds and eclasses, highlights keywords and also
provides a hook for your own customisation.
