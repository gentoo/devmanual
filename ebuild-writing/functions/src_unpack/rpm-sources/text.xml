<title>RPM sources</title>

<p>
If a package is supplied as an .rpm file, you should:
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
inherit rpm
</codesample>

<p>
If you don't need to do anything in the unpack phase, then you are
finished as the <c>rpm.eclass</c> exports a default <c>src_unpack</c>
that will unpack the RPM files.
</p>

<p>
If you do need to call additional unpack functions then override <c>src_unpack</c> in a
manner such as:
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
src_unpack() {
	rpm_src_unpack ${A}
	cd "${S}"

	use ssl &amp;&amp; eapply "${FILESDIR}/${PV}/${P}-ssl.patch"
}
</codesample>

<note>
<c>${A}</c> can contain non-rpm files since the rpm eclass will call
the normal <c>unpack</c> function for files that are not in the RPM
format.
</note>

<title>Example RPM handling</title>
<body>

<p>
Here is an ebuild snippet that is based upon the fetchmail source RPM
from SuSE 9.2. The ebuild snippet is complete enough to work with the
<c>ebuild unpack</c> command. The ebuild will download the source file from
the OSU SuSE mirror, unpack the file and apply the included
patches. The filename should be <c>suse-fetchmail-6.2.5.54.1.ebuild</c>.

# Need to test if the file can be unpacked with rpmoffset and cpio

# To force the use of rpmoffset and cpio instead of rpm2cpio from
