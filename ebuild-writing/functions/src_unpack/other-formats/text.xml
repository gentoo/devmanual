<section>
<title>Shar Files</title>
<body>
<p>
If a package is supplied as a <c>.shar</c> file, you should repackage it locally
into a <c>.tar.bz2</c>. It may also be useful to ask upstream to use a friendlier
package format <d/> however, if they ship <c>.shar</c>, chances are they haven't
done a release in at least ten years.
