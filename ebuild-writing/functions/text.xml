<title>Ebuild Functions</title>

<body>
<p>
When installing packages from source, the function call order is <c>pkg_setup</c>,
<c>src_unpack</c>, <c>src_prepare</c>, <c>src_compile</c>, <c>src_test</c> (optional, <c>FEATURES="test"</c>),
<c>src_install</c>, <c>pkg_preinst</c>, <c>pkg_postinst</c>. When installing packages
from a binary, the function call order is <c>pkg_setup</c>, <c>pkg_preinst</c>,
<c>pkg_postinst</c>.
As some phases haven't been introduced from the beginning, you can have a look at
<uri link="::ebuild-writing/eapi"/> for an overview, what have been introduced in which EAPI.

<p>
The <c>pkg_prerm</c> and <c>pkg_postrm</c> functions are called when uninstalling a
package. The <c>pkg_config</c> function is used for any special package
configuration <d/> it is only run when explicitly requested by the user. The
<c>pkg_nofetch</c> function is used when a <c>RESTRICT="fetch"</c> package needs to
obtain some <c>SRC_URI</c> components.
</p>

<p>
Between the transition from <c>pkg_preinst</c> to <c>pkg_postinst</c>, files are
copied over to the live filesystem from the sandboxed temporary installation
location, and Portage records digests of the files installed.
</p>

<p>
When testing or debugging, you can instruct Portage to execute a specific function
from an ebuild by using the <c>ebuild</c> command, see the <c>ebuild(1)</c> manual
page for further information.
