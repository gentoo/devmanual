<title>Default <c>src_test</c></title>
<body>
<p>The default test phase in EAPI 6 is equivalent to the following:</p>
<codesample lang="ebuild">
src_test() {
	if nonfatal emake check -n &amp;&gt; /dev/null; then
		emake check
	elif nonfatal emake test -n &amp;&gt; /dev/null; then
		emake test
	fi
}
</codesample>

<title>Sample <c>src_test</c></title>
<body>
<codesample lang="ebuild">
src_test() {
	cd "${S}"/src/testdir || die

	# Test 49 won't work inside a Portage environment
	sed -i -e 's~test49.out~~g' Makefile || die

	# Try to run the non-gui tests only
	# pass -j1 if tests do not support being run in parallel
	emake -j1 test-nongui
}

<title>Supporting test suites in packages</title>
<body>

<p>
If the packaged software is equipped with a test suite, it is sensible
to run it. Sometimes the package will need additional dependencies for this,
i.e., dependencies that are only required to run the test suite. Such test-only
dependencies should be specified in DEPEND or BDEPEND behind a USE flag;
often, the <c>test</c> USE flag will be used for this. Please refer to the
section on <uri link="::general-concepts/dependencies/#Test dependencies"/>
for more information.
</p>

<p>
Note that the <c>test</c> USE flag is only necessary if there are
test dependencies, tests are being built conditionally, or it is desirable
to vary behaviour based on whether tests will be run (e.g. downloading large
files in SRC_URI). It is not appropriate to use the flag to simply indicate that
tests exist and are expected to pass.
</p>

<p>
Often the default <c>src_test</c> is fine. Sometimes it is necessary
to remove certain tests from the list if they cannot be used with a
Portage environment. Reasons for such a failure could include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Needing to work with files which are disallowed by the sandbox.
  </li>
  <li>Requiring user input (<c>src_test</c> must not be interactive).</li>
  <li>Requiring root privileges.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Usually, removing the relevant test from the <c>Makefile</c>
using <c>sed</c> or skipping a particular <c>make</c> target is
sufficient.
</p>

<p>
Try to ensure that tests work properly for your ebuild. A good test
suite is extremely helpful for arch maintainers.
Sometimes it is necessary to skip tests entirely. This can be done by
setting <c>RESTRICT="test"</c> in the ebuild.
</p>

<note>
If upstream provides a test suite that doesn't work, consider talking
to them about getting it fixed. A broken test suite requires developers
to investigate each test failure in order to determine whether it is
genuine or indicates a broken test.

<title>Tests that require network or service access</title>
<body>
<p>
Sometimes test suites (and other build-time programs) attempt to use
remote or local network, or production servers running on the host. All
of these are strictly forbidden. Developers should either fix such tests
to work in an isolated environment, or disable them completely unless
explicitly allowed by the user. At the bare minimum, the tests must
not fail with <c>FEATURES=network-sandbox</c> being enabled.
</p>

<p>
Internet access within the build procedure is forbidden for
the following reasons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    the build may be running in an environment with no or restricted
    Internet access, and this must not cause the tests (build) to fail;
  </li>

  <li>
    the Internet connection may be unstable (e.g. poor reception)
    in which case an interrupted connection or packet loss must not
    cause the tests to fail or hang, and it should not cause unnecessary
    delays;
  </li>

  <li>
    the Internet connection may be running on a limited data plan
    in which case the additional network use may cause additional
    charges or other inconveniences to the user;
  </li>

  <li>
    the remote network services used by the tests may become unavailable
    temporarily or permanently, causing unexpected test failures;
  </li>

  <li>
    accessing remote sites always poses a privacy issue, and possibly
    a threat to security (e.g. through inadvertently exposing
    information about the system).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Fixing tests that require Internet access usually requires cooperation
with upstream, and porting the tests to use test techniques such as
mocking or using replay data. For this reason, developers report
the issue upstream and skip tests that require network access.
It is recommended to explicitly leave a note as to why the tests are
skipped, so that other developers can re-enable them locally to run
a more complete test suite.
</p>

<p>
It is generally considered acceptable to rely on IPv4 <c>localhost</c> being
resolvable and available for binding. Tests should only connect to services
that are started as part of the testsuite. It is not acceptable to connect
to daemons run outside the test environment.
</p>

<p>
Local server access within the build procedure is forbidden for the following
reasons:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    tests must run reliably independently of whether a particular
    server is running throughout the build process or not,
  </li>

  <li>
    using production services for running tests is extremely
    <b>dangerous</b> as it may inadvertently expose bugs in those
    services, causing instability, data loss or even exposing security
    vulnerabilities.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Fixing tests that require access to local services is usually done
via starting additional isolated instances of those services during
the test phase. Those services must either be running on a UNIX
socket or on the loopback interface, to reliably prevent remote access.
</p>

<p>
For all networked services exposed during the test phase (either by
the ebuild or the tests themselves), UNIX sockets are strongly preferred
over IP sockets as they provide better means for unique naming
and access control mechanisms. IP sockets can be subject to port
collisions with other local services and they can be accessed by local
system users who may exploit a vulnerability through the tests.
</p>

<p>
Additional protection against those issues is provided through
<c>FEATURES=network-sandbox</c>. However, this is only an optional
Portage feature relying on specific Linux kernel namespace mechanisms
and developers should not rely on it being enabled.

<title>Tests that require X11</title>
<body>
<p>
Some packages include tests (or other build-time applications) that
attempt to use the user's X11 session and fail being unable to connect
to it. Those tests need to be fixed to work independently of the X11
server that might or might not be running when packages are being built.
</p>

<p>
If the program in question does not strictly need X11 but merely
attempts to take opportunity of the <c>DISPLAY</c> variable being set,
the best solution is to simply unset this variable in the ebuild.
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
src_test() {
	# tests attempt to connect to X11 and fail when it is set
	# however, they work just fine without X11
	unset DISPLAY

	default
}
</codesample>

<p>
If the package actually requires a running X11 server to run
the complete test suite, you can use the <c>virtualx</c> eclass to
provide an isolated Xvfb environment for the tests to use. It provides
a virtual X11 display that is not connected to any physical device
and that programs can use reliably.
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
inherit virtualx

src_test() {
	virtx default
}
