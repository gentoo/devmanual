<title>Building a package</title>

<body>
<p>
The <c>emake</c> function should be used to call <c>make</c>. This will ensure that
the user's <c>MAKEOPTS</c> are used correctly. The <c>emake</c> function passes on
any arguments provided, so it can be used to make non-default targets (<c>emake
extras</c>), for example. Occasionally you might encounter a screwy non-autotools
<c>Makefile</c> that explodes with <c>emake</c>, but this is rare.
</p>

<p>
Builds should be tested with various <c>-j</c> settings in <c>MAKEOPTS</c> to ensure
that the build parallelises properly. If a package does <e>not</e> parallelise
cleanly, it should be patched.
</p>

<p>
If patching <e>really</e> isn't an option, <c>emake -j1</c> should be
used. However, when doing this, please remember that you are seriously
hurting build times for many non-x86 users in particular. Forcing
<c>-j1</c> can increase build times from a few minutes to an hour on
some MIPS and SPARC systems.

<title>Fixing compiler usage</title>
<body>

<p>
Sometimes a package will try to use a bizarre compiler, or will need to be told
which compiler to use. In these situations, the <c>tc-getCC()</c> function from
<uri link="::eclass-reference/toolchain-funcs.eclass/"/> should be used.
Other similar functions are available <d/> these are documented in
<c>man toolchain-funcs.eclass</c>.
</p>

<p>
Note that packages should always respect the user's <c>CC</c> preference
and must not rely on convenience symlinks such as <c>/usr/bin/cc</c>
or <c>/usr/bin/gcc</c>. A tracker <uri link="https://bugs.gentoo.org/243502">
bug</uri> exists to document such issues. Additional documentation exists on the
<uri link="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Toolchain/use_native_symlinks">
wiki</uri>.
</p>

<note>
It is <e>not</e> correct to use the <c>${CC}</c> variable for this purpose.
</note>

<p>
Sometimes a package will not use the user's <c>${CFLAGS}</c> or <c>${LDFLAGS}</c>.
This must be worked around, as sometimes these variables are used for specifying
critical ABI options. In these cases, the build scripts should be modified (for
example, with <c>sed</c> or via a patch) to use <c>${CFLAGS}</c> or
<c>${LDFLAGS}</c> correctly.
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
inherit flag-o-matic toolchain-funcs

src_prepare() {
	default

	# We have a weird Makefile to work with which ignores our
	# compiler preferences. yay!
	# Note the single quotes (hence the delimiter is not an issue)
	sed -i -e 's:cc -O2:$(CC) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS):' Makefile \
		|| die "sed fix failed. Uh-oh..."
}

src_compile() {
	# -Os not happy
	replace-flags -Os -O2

	emake CC="$(tc-getCC)" \
		CPPFLAGS="${CPPFLAGS}" \
		CFLAGS="${CFLAGS}" \
		LDFLAGS="${LDFLAGS}"
}
</codesample>

<note>
Try to not substitute the value with <c>sed</c> directly, but instead make the
build script use the variables. The variables may contain characters such as a
slash, a comma, or a colon, which are often used with <c>sed</c>, and this
would break its syntax.
</note>

<p>
Portage performs a QA check which verifies if LDFLAGS are respected. This QA check
is enabled only when <c>LDFLAGS</c> variable contains <c>-Wl,--hash-style=gnu</c>.
(This flag can be used only on systems which use <c>sys-libs/glibc</c> except for
machines with a MIPS CPU.)
