<title>Patching with epatch</title>

<body>
<p>
The canonical way of applying patches in ebuilds is to
use <c>epatch</c> (from <c>eutils.eclass</c>, which you must make sure
to import!) inside <c>src_prepare</c>. This function automatically
handles <c>-p</c> levels, <c>gunzip</c> and so on as necessary. Also note that olds ebuild may still use src_unpack to apply patches. This is because those ebuilds are based in EAPI="1". You are advised to use EAPI="2" and apply your patches in src_prepare function instead.
</p>

<p>
Note that distributing modified tarballs rather than a vanilla tarball
and patches is <e>highly</e> discouraged.

<section>
<title>Basic <c>epatch</c></title>
<body>

<p>
In its simplest form, <c>epatch</c> takes a single filename and
applies that patch. It will automatically <c>die</c> if the apply
fails. The following is taken from <c>app-misc/detox</c>:
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
src_unpack() {
    unpack ${A}
    cd "${S}"
    epatch "${FILESDIR}/${P}-destdir.patch"
    epatch "${FILESDIR}/${P}-parallel_build.patch"
}
</codesample>

<p>
For larger patches, using <c>mirror://gentoo/</c> rather
than <c>files/</c> is more appropriate. In these situations, it is
usually best to <c>bzip2</c> the patch in question (as opposed to
<c>files/</c> patches, which must not be compressed). For example,
from <c>app-admin/showconsole</c>:
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
src_unpack() {
    unpack ${A}
    cd "${S}"
    epatch "${WORKDIR}/${P}-suse-update.patch.bz2"
    epatch "${FILESDIR}/${PV}-no-TIOCGDEV.patch"
}
</codesample>
<p>As stated before, if you are using EAPI >=2, you should apply the patches in the <uri link="::ebuild-writing/functions/src_prepare">src_prepare</uri> function</p>
<codesample lang="ebuild">
src_prepare() {
	epatch "${WORKDIR}/${P}-suse-update.patch.bz2"
	epatch "${FILESDIR}/${PV}-no-TIOCGDEV.patch"
}
</codesample>

<p>
Remember to add the patch to <c>SRC_URI</c>.
</p>
</body>

<subsection>
<title>CVS Keyword Lines and Patches</title>
<body>
<p>
If your patch includes any changes to CVS <c>$Id: $</c>
(or <c>$Header: $</c>, or <c>$Date: $</c>) lines, it cannot be
distributed under <c>files/</c>, since CVS will clobber the patch when
you commit. In these situations, either remove this hunk of the patch
manually, or mirror the file.

<section>
<title>Multiple Patches with <c>epatch</c></title>
<body>

<p>
epatch can also apply multiple patches (which can be selectively based
upon arch) from a single directory. This can be useful if upstream
have releases that need more patches.
</p>

<p>
A simple example:
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
src_unpack() {
    unpack ${A}
    cd "${S}"
    EPATCH_SOURCE="${WORKDIR}/patches" EPATCH_SUFFIX="patch" \
        EPATCH_FORCE="yes" epatch
}
</codesample>

<p>
Here, one of the <c>SRC_URI</c> components is a tarball containing
many patches with file extension <c>.patch</c>.
</p>

<p>
Variables which may be defined include:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Variable</th>
    <th>Purpose</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti><c>EPATCH_SOURCE</c></ti>
    <ti>Specifies the directory in which epatch looks for patches.</ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti><c>EPATCH_SUFFIX</c></ti>
    <ti>File extension for patches.</ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti><c>EPATCH_OPTS</c></ti>
    <ti>Default options to <c>patch</c>.</ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti><c>EPATCH_EXCLUDE</c></ti>
    <ti>List of patches to exclude.</ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti><c>EPATCH_FORCE</c></ti>
    <ti>
    Force epatch to apply patches even if they do not follow the
    canonical naming form (set to <c>yes</c>).
    </ti>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
Bulk patches should be named in the form
<c>??_${ARCH}_foo.${EPATCH_SUFFIX}</c>. If they are
not, <c>EPATCH_FORCE="yes"</c> must be set. To apply a patch on <c>all</c>
archs, use all for the <c>${ARCH}</c> part.
