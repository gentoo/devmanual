<title>Patching with epatch and eapply</title>

<body>
<p>
The canonical way of applying patches in ebuilds is to
use <c>epatch</c> (from <c>epatch.eclass</c>, which you must make sure
to inherit!) inside <c>src_prepare</c>. This function automatically
handles <c>-p</c> levels, <c>gunzip</c> and so on as necessary.
</p>

<p>
Starting with EAPI=7, this function is banned and <c>eapply</c> must be used.
</p>

<p>
Beginning with EAPI=6, a new function <c>eapply</c> was added to apply patches
without the need for an eclass.
This function differs from epatch in several ways:
</p>

<ul>
<li><c>eapply</c> will not unpack patches for you.</li>
<li>
The default patch level is -p1.
Other patch levels must be specified manually or the command will fail.
</li>
<li>
When specifying a directory, at least one file with a name ending in .patch or .diff
must exist or the command fails.  Other files are ignored.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that distributing modified tarballs rather than a vanilla tarball
and patches is <e>highly</e> discouraged.
</p>

<title>Basic <c>eapply</c></title>
<body>
<p>
The default src_prepare function will look for a global PATCHES array to apply
a list of patches for you.
</p>
<codesample lang="ebuild">
PATCHES=(
	"${FILESDIR}/${P}-destdir.patch"
	"${FILESDIR}/${P}-parallel_build.patch"
)
</codesample>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Advanced <c>eapply</c></title>
<body>
<p>
This example shows how different patch levels can be applied:
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
src_prepare() {
	eapply -p2 "${WORKDIR}/${P}-suse-update.patch"
	eapply -p0 "${FILESDIR}/${PV}-no-TIOCGDEV.patch"
	eapply "${FILESDIR}/${PV}-gcc-6.patch"
	eapply_user
}
</codesample>
</body>
</section>

<section>
<title>Basic <c>epatch</c></title>
<body>

<p>
In its simplest form, <c>epatch</c> takes a single filename and
applies that patch. It will automatically <c>die</c> if the apply
fails. The following is taken from <c>app-misc/detox</c>:
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
src_prepare() {
	epatch "${FILESDIR}/${P}-destdir.patch"
	epatch "${FILESDIR}/${P}-parallel_build.patch"
}
</codesample>

<p>
For larger patches, using
<uri link="::general-concepts/mirrors/#Suitable Download Hosts">
your devspace</uri> rather than
<uri link="::ebuild-writing/variables/#Predefined Read-Only Variables">
${FILESDIR}</uri> is more appropriate. In these situations, it is
usually best to compress the patch in question with <c>xz</c> or
<c>bzip2</c> (as opposed to <c>${FILESDIR}</c> patches, which must not
be compressed). For example, from <c>app-admin/showconsole</c>:
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
src_prepare() {
	epatch "${WORKDIR}/${P}-suse-update.patch.bz2"
	epatch "${FILESDIR}/${PV}-no-TIOCGDEV.patch"
}
</codesample>

<p>
Remember to add the patch to <c>SRC_URI</c>.

<section>
<title>Multiple Patches with <c>epatch</c></title>
<body>

<p>
epatch can also apply multiple patches (which can be selectively based
upon arch) from a single directory. This can be useful if upstream
have releases that need more patches.
</p>

<p>
A simple example:
</p>

<codesample lang="ebuild">
src_prepare() {
	EPATCH_SOURCE="${WORKDIR}/patches" EPATCH_SUFFIX="patch" \
		EPATCH_FORCE="yes" epatch
}
</codesample>

<p>
Here, one of the <c>SRC_URI</c> components is a tarball containing
many patches with file extension <c>.patch</c>.
</p>

<p>
Variables which may be defined include:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Variable</th>
    <th>Purpose</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti><c>EPATCH_SOURCE</c></ti>
    <ti>Specifies the directory in which epatch looks for patches.</ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti><c>EPATCH_SUFFIX</c></ti>
    <ti>File extension for patches.</ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti><c>EPATCH_OPTS</c></ti>
    <ti>Default options to <c>patch</c>.</ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti><c>EPATCH_EXCLUDE</c></ti>
    <ti>List of patches to exclude.</ti>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <ti><c>EPATCH_FORCE</c></ti>
    <ti>
    Force epatch to apply patches even if they do not follow the
    canonical naming form (set to <c>yes</c>).
    </ti>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
Bulk patches should be named in the form
<c>??_${ARCH}_foo.${EPATCH_SUFFIX}</c>. If they are
not, <c>EPATCH_FORCE="yes"</c> must be set. To apply a patch on <c>all</c>
archs, use all for the <c>${ARCH}</c> part.
